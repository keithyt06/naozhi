// process_turn.go — turn-boundary coordination helpers.
//
// Moved from process.go (Phase 4 of docs/rfc/process-split.md).
// Zero semantic change; pure file move.
//
// This file owns:
//   - findResultSince: EventLog fallback scanner used by Send when
//     eventCh drops or closes before a result is delivered; also used
//     by drainStaleEvents' timeout branches.
//   - drainStaleEvents: settle-window guard that runs at the top of
//     every Send turn to absorb any interrupted-turn residue before
//     the new prompt is written.
//   - isChanAlive: tiny invariant helper guarding against send-on-
//     closed-eventCh panics; relies on readLoop's defer ordering.
//   - sanitizeStderrLine + maxStderrLogLineBytes: ANSI / log-injection
//     scrubber for CLI stderr, only referenced from readLoop but kept
//     here to keep the turn-file's "log hygiene" job on one surface.
