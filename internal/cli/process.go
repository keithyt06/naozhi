//   - nil: control_request was written; the next Send() will drain the
//     interrupted result via the settle loop.
//   - ErrNoActiveTurn: process is alive but no turn is in flight; nothing
//     was written, no flags were set. Callers should not log success.
//   - ErrInterruptUnsupported: protocol (e.g. ACP) has no stdin-level
//     interrupt primitive; callers should fall back to Interrupt().
//   - wrapped transport error: the write failed; flags are rolled back so
//     a subsequent Send() does not burn the settle budget waiting for a
