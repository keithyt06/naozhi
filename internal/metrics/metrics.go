// Package metrics exposes a small set of process-wide counters backed by
// stdlib expvar. The goal is operator observability — a naozhi deployment
// promises "10K users" scale but historically shipped zero metrics (only
// pprof), so post-incident analysis relied on parsing journalctl. This
// package adds counters covering the highest-signal lifecycle events:
//
//   - SessionCreateTotal:     successful spawnSession calls
//   - SessionEvictTotal:      LRU eviction frees a slot
//   - CLISpawnTotal:          wrapper.Spawn returns a Process (new CLI child)
//   - WSAuthFailTotal:        WebSocket auth_fail reply emitted (aggregate)
//   - WSAuthFailRateLimitedTotal: subset of WSAuthFailTotal triggered by the
//     per-IP rate limiter (brute-force throttling active). R172-ARCH-D10.
//   - WSAuthFailInvalidTokenTotal: subset of WSAuthFailTotal triggered by a
//     wrong token presented to an otherwise-allowed IP. R172-ARCH-D10.
//   - ShimRestartTotal:       shim.Manager.StartShimWithBackend succeeds
//   - SpawnPanicRecoveredTotal: panicSafeSpawn absorbs a wrapper.Spawn panic
//     (shim exec crash / bogus protocol Init / etc.). A non-zero value is an
//     operator-actionable reliability signal: the recover path keeps naozhi
//     alive but the underlying bug should be investigated. R172-ARCH-D10.
//   - ShimReconnectGraceBackfillTotal: deferred JSONL history load fired for a
//     shim-managed session whose ReconnectShims pass did not supply history
//     within shimReconnectGraceDelay (R53-ARCH-001 fallback path).
//     R172-ARCH-D10.
//   - Interrupt{Sent,NoTurn,Unsupported,Error}Total: per-outcome counts for
//     Router.InterruptSessionViaControl. NoSession is deliberately NOT
//     counted — a key-does-not-exist lookup isn't a signal about interrupt
//     behaviour, and counting it would blur the denominator when computing
//     "interrupts that reached the CLI" ratios. R172-ARCH-D10.
//
// Counters are published via the stdlib expvar package, which auto-registers
// itself on /debug/vars. Exposing them requires routing /debug/vars through
// the dashboard mux — the naozhi HTTP server registers that route via
// internal/server (see debug_expvar.go) behind the same auth + loopback
// guard as pprof.
//
// Design choices:
//
//  1. Use expvar.Int (atomic int64 + JSON marshaling) rather than a custom
//     type. Zero dependencies, stdlib-stable since Go 1.0. A future upgrade
//     to Prometheus client_golang would replace the vars with prometheus
//     counters without touching call sites (accept an interface, return
//     struct).
//  2. Counters are package-level singletons exposed as *expvar.Int so call
//     sites write `metrics.SessionCreateTotal.Add(1)` with no further
//     wiring. This mirrors the stdlib http.DefaultServeMux pattern.
//  3. No labels. expvar is untyped; label cardinality enforcement belongs
//     to a real metrics lib. For MVP observability the absence of labels
//     is a feature (operators can't accidentally blow up memory with
//     per-user tags).

	// --- Startup phase timing gauges (RNEW-OPS-414) -----------------------
	//
	// Cold-start observability: historically the only signal operators had
	// for a slow boot was grepping journalctl timestamps across slog lines.
	// These gauges record milliseconds from process start (t0 captured in
	// main) to the end of each logical phase, set exactly once per process.
	// Values are cumulative (phase N ms = total ms from t0 through phase N)
	// so operators can read the table top-to-bottom and see per-phase
	// duration as the difference between adjacent rows.
	//
	// Gauge semantics (not counter): values are written once via Set, never
	// Add'd. Naming uses `_ms` suffix — NOT `_total` — so dashboards treat
	// them as gauges and the `*_total` doc-sync regex correctly ignores
	// them. Using expvar.Int (int64 millis) keeps zero dependencies and
	// avoids float encoding surprises downstream. Prometheus migration
	// path: swap to `prometheus.NewGauge` with `_milliseconds` suffix, or
	// to `_seconds` converted to float.
	//
	// Measurement pattern at each call site:
	//     metrics.StartupPhaseXxxMs.Set(time.Since(t0).Milliseconds())
	// Set takes <1µs and cannot block boot.

	// StartupPhaseConfigMs is set after config.Load returns — captures
